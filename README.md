# Performance Testing Using Jmeter


# Introduction 

In the performance testing test project, I took two APIs.

<h3>1.Restful-Booker (Books API):</h3>
*Purpose: Load and stress testing.
* Test Setup:
   -  Simulate varying loads using threads to test response times under different traffic conditions.
   -  Use HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and validate responses with assertions.

2.Dmoney (Website Transaction API):
Purpose: API chaining for transactions (Deposit, SendMoney, Payment).
Test Setup:
Use CSV Data files to run dynamic transaction data.
Simulate multiple transactions using three threads to concurrently run Deposit, SendMoney, and Payment APIs in a chain.

This setup ensures both load testing and real-world transaction performance testing using JMeter.
